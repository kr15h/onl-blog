Hi, my name is Krisjanis Rijnieks, I come from Riga, Latvia and am currently a part of Aalto Fablab, Aalto University in Espoo, Finland. I made this blog to document my participation in the [Open Networked Learning](https://www.opennetworkedlearning.se/) (ONL) course.

I am interested in ONL because I am teaching another globally distributed course known as the [Fab Academy](https://fabacademy.org). In ONL I expect to find new methods that I could use in my future practice.
