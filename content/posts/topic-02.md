Maha Bali, PhD  @bali_maha

Connotations of openness in your culture.
Knowledge is like water and air. Egyptioan educatir and author Taha HUssein

It's necessary to us and it best served clean.

What is your personal interest in openness?

Cupcake story. People may feel betrayed if somebody uses their work without permission. CC lincenses. There are things that we create for sharing and some that are not.

It is important to know what are the intentions of the creators. Managing openness.

If something is set up as a company, it probably means that it has been set up for profit, not openness.

Alastair asks: Do we need platform literacy?

Open Edu Practices. Open peer-review for example.

The transition to learner-focus. Instead of showing how to make a video, make students to make a video and publish it online.

Content centric - Process centric.

A lot of content comes from dominant institutions. Creating content is not free.

All created teaching content is going to be biased in one way or another. It is important to manage the bias. One could at least tell that there is a possibility for bias in the material.

Transparency is important and lack of it can work against.

It is well known that most Wikipedia editors are white males. That's why Wikipedia editing is being brought up in feminist discourse as feminist wikipedia-thons.
